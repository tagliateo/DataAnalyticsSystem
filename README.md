### Overview of the Code

The code is a Java program that processes stock prices over a specified period. It includes methods to calculate the average price, the maximum price, the occurrences of a specific price, and the cumulative sum of stock prices stored in both an array and an ArrayList.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Imports and Class Declaration**:
   ```java
   import java.util.ArrayList;

   public class Main {
   ```
    - The `ArrayList` class from the `java.util` package is imported to allow the use of dynamic arrays.
    - The `Main` class is defined to encapsulate the program.

2. **Method to Calculate Average Price**:
   ```java
   public static float calculateAveragePrice(float[] stockPrices) {
       float sum = 0.0f;
       for (float price : stockPrices) {
           sum += price;
       }
       return sum / stockPrices.length;
   }
   ```
    - This method takes an array of `float` values representing stock prices.
    - It initializes a `sum` variable and iterates over `stockPrices`, accumulating the total sum.
    - The average is calculated by dividing the sum by the number of prices and returned as a `float`.

3. **Method to Find Maximum Price**:
   ```java
   public static float findMaximumPrice(float[] stockPrices) {
       float max = Float.MIN_VALUE;
       for (float price : stockPrices) {
           if (price > max) {
               max = price;
           }
       }
       return max;
   }
   ```
    - This method finds the maximum price in the stockPrices array.
    - It initializes `max` with the smallest possible float value and iterates through `stockPrices`.
    - If a price is greater than the current `max`, it updates the `max`.
    - The maximum value is returned.

4. **Method to Count Occurrences of a Specific Price**:
   ```java
   public static int countOccurrences(float[] stockPrices, float targetPrice) {
       int count = 0;
       for (float price : stockPrices) {
           if (price == targetPrice) {
               count++;
           }
       }
       return count;
   }
   ```
    - This method counts how many times a specified `targetPrice` appears in the `stockPrices` array.
    - It initializes a `count` variable, iterates through the array, and increments `count` whenever `targetPrice` matches.
    - The total count is returned.

5. **Method to Compute Cumulative Sum**:
   ```java
   public static ArrayList<Float> computeCumulativeSum(ArrayList<Float> stockPrices) {
       ArrayList<Float> cumulativeSum = new ArrayList<>();
       float runningTotal = 0.0f;

       for (float price : stockPrices) {
           runningTotal += price;
           cumulativeSum.add(runningTotal);
       }
       return cumulativeSum;
   }
   ```
    - This method takes an `ArrayList<Float>` and computes the cumulative sum of the stock prices.
    - A new ArrayList `cumulativeSum` is created to store cumulative totals.
    - It iterates over the input list, adding the current price to `runningTotal` and adding that total to `cumulativeSum`.

6. **Main Method**:
   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       float[] stockPricesArray = {150.5f, 152.3f, ... };
       ArrayList<Float> stockPricesList = new ArrayList<>();
       // (List population)

       float targetPrice = 150.5f;

       System.out.println("**************Hello********************");

       float averagePriceArray = calculateAveragePrice(stockPricesArray);
       System.out.println("Average Stock Price (Array): " + averagePriceArray);

       float maximumPrice = findMaximumPrice(stockPricesArray);
       System.out.println("\nMaximum Stock Price (Array): " + maximumPrice);

       int occurrences = countOccurrences(stockPricesArray, maximumPrice);
       System.out.println("\nNumber of occurrences: " + occurrences);

       ArrayList<Float> cumulativeSum = computeCumulativeSum(stockPricesList);
       System.out.println("\nCumulative Sum of Stock Prices:");
       for (Float sum : cumulativeSum) {
           System.out.println("Printing sum " + sum);
       }
   }
   ```

    - This is the main entry point of the program.
    - It initializes an array (`stockPricesArray`) and an ArrayList (`stockPricesList`) with stock prices for 10 days.
    - It specifies a target price to analyze.
    - Then it calls the previously defined methods to compute the average price, maximum price, count occurrences of the maximum price, and compute the cumulative sum.
    - It prints all relevant results to the console, interspersed with informative messages.

### Output
The output will consist of:
- The average stock price from the array.
- The maximum stock price found in the array.
- The number of occurrences of the maximum price.
- The cumulative sum of stock prices from the ArrayList, printed out in a readable format.

### Best Practices
The code adheres to many coding best practices:
- **Meaningful Variable Names**: Variable names clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., `stockPrices`, `targetPrice`, `runningTotal`).
- **Clear Method Definitions**: Each method has a single responsibility, making them easier to understand and maintain.
- **Use of Collections**: The Java `ArrayList` is used for dynamic data, enhancing flexibility.

### Output Screenshot
The screenshot of the output can be obtained by running the program and capturing the console window or through an IDE's console output functionality.

This structure not only fulfills the requirements of the assignment but also provides a clear and maintainable codebase for future enhancements or analysis.
